# How to use

First, you need to be in the backend folder and run `npm install` to run all the needed modules of the backend. Then, you need to run `node app.js` to start your backend server. The API will be hosted on localhost at the port 9103.

Before running the API make sure that your Apache and MySQL from XAMPP will be running and that you have created the database.
