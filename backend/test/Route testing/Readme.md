### Instructions:
- Make sure Postman is installed
- Run `./Setup_tester.py`. The script will copy the files from this repository to the postman working directory. If Postman has the default configuration you can simply accept the prompt and close the executable. If not, simply follow the instructions.
- Open Postman, click "import" in "My Workspace" and select either the `Postman_full_test_suite.json` or `Postman_presentation.json`.
- Once the collection is created, click on it, select `run collection` (under the three dots) and finally `Run`.
